## Inspiration
Animal Crossing is a social simulation game where you are plopped on a deserted island, and have to build up a village from scratch. It sounds super random, but, as the internet has proved, is incredibly addicting. A huge part of this game involves acquiring items around your island and selling them to expand your home or the island setup. So, I wanted to analyze different trends in the types of items I collect, their cumulative value, and how I can optimize my time to make big bucks in the game. 💸

## Installation
1. Install Plotly: `pip install plotly`
2. Install Pandas: `pip install pandas`
3. Install NumPy: `pip install numpy`
4. Install Jupyter `pip install jupyter`

## Usage
#### To launch the notebook:
    $ jupyter notebook
### To run the exercises:
1. Within the Jupyter notebook, find the `animal_crossing_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
2. Press the green <key>play</key> button to run each cell of the notebook.
3. For each plot created, hover over the graph to zoom into particular regions. On the top right hand corner of every plot, there is also a useful toolbar.
